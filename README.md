VENICE ART SHOW
(MVP)
 
MISSION STATEMENT:
A platform that targets artists and art lovers, who can display their pieces for sale along with purchasing pieces from other users. We chose this project as it seemed to be a great opportunity to gain real-world experience within a situation that we could likely encounter in future employment.
 
DESCRIPTION:
Venice Art Show is a platform in which you can create a user profile, post your created artworks for sale, and purchase another user’s artwork. All users have the opportunity to be a buyer, seller, or both.

  USERS:
  Users will create a profile with a username of their choice and an optional Biography. All users must use an email to sign-up with. With this single user profile,  users will be able to sell and buy products.
  SELLING:
      As a seller will be able to create a new product for sale for each art piece they want to list. After this listing is created, they will have the option to go in and update the product or even delete the product.
   BUYING:
      When buying you can run a general search for art pieces by price range or media type. You can also run a more specific search to find pieces by a specific creator or by the Art piece title. Once the buyer finds the piece they want to purchase, they will be able to create the order. Buyers will then be able to search back through all their orders to see their past purchases.
 
FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
While Venice Art Show is currently in its Most Viable Product phase, there are some future implementations that are envisioned for future release.
1.  	“Admin” role to manage database
  o   Currently, all users have access to the database and can run all functions for their specific userId. Future implementation would allow a differentiation between typical “users” and an “admin” that will be able to run functions for all products and users in the system.
 
2.  	Inventory Tracking
  o   When selling products, sellers will be able to list multiple of the same product and the inventory will automatically be adjusted based off the orders placed.
 
3.  	Multiple products in an order
  o   In the MVP an order is only for a single piece. If a user wants to buy two different products, they must create two different orders. This future feature will allow multiple products to be listed on one single order.
 
4.  	Interactive comments on art pieces
  o   This feature would allow a “Social Media” aspect within Venice Art Show. Users could comment back and forth on different art pieces allowing a more interactive experience.
 
5.  	Display option for artwork pieces not for sale
  o   Incorporating the “Social Media” aspect mentioned, this would allow creators to display pieces they have created and can receive feedback from other users.
